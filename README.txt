User Manual:
   Mass Add User Records tabs takes in multiple lines of text in the format Name,Email and attempts to add it to the database,
   All rejected attempts are sent back to the user in the same textbox for editing.
   Mass Add(upload version):
   Takes in a .txt/.csv file and attempts to add as many as possible,all errors/successes are printed out in the callback but no other data is saved.
   
Accomplishments:
   Getting drupal and the given codebase to work(it doesnt seem like much but im quite proud of anything that the entire morning and afternoon
   to debug even if it ended up being because mysql 5.5? doesnt allow more than 1 timestamp)
   The $errordump array in the regular mass add,im actually quite proud of this depite its simplicity because i think its actually quite useful,instead of giving back the entire
   text when there might only be 1 or 2 errors after the form rebuild,it returns only the lines that didnt make it into the
   database for whatever reason.
